## Letter Guessing Game
This is a guessing game that asks the user to guess by letter to reveal the secret word
* You start by either choosing the category fruits or vegetables
* Depending if the user chose fruits or vegetables, a list of the one the user picked chooses a random element from the list and sets it to the secret word
* The code will show a number of dashes that represent the number of letters in the word
* Then it will prompt the user to start guessing by letter

### Guessing
* Incorrect Guess: They will **lose a chance** and will be told that the letter guessed is not in the secret word
* Correct Guess: The letter will show up in the dashes and the user will not lose a chance
    * If the letter guessed is in the word more than once, the letter will count for **all the times** it is in the word

#### Win vs Lose
* The code stores the user's guesses in a list and if the length of that list is equal to the length of thr secret word it will break out of the loop and you win
* If the user runs out of guesses it will break out of the loop and tell the user they ran out if guesses

*Single asterisks make italics*

**Double asterisks make text bold**

* Asterisk + space before text gives bulleted list
  * Tabbed asterisks give indented lists
